![Snapshot of the project]()

This is my Todo-weather Dashboard project. This project is heavily inspired by the [Momentum browser extension](https://momentumdash.com/). Momentum is a dashboard I use everyday and I wanted to create my own. The project is aimed for use on a desktop/laptop monitor but is responsive and accessible on a range of devices.
